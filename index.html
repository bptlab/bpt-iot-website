        The Internet of Things (IoT) is the inter-networking of physical objects (the things), being such things embedded systems with electronics hardware, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity. Such connected things collect and exchange data. Each thing is uniquely identifiable through its embedded computing system and is able to interoperate within the existing network infrastructure. The interconnection of these smart objects/things is expected to usher in automation in nearly all fields. This creates opportunities for more direct integration of the physical world into computer-based and digitized systems, and results in improved efficiency, accuracy, and economic benefits besides increased automation and reduced human intervention. Experts estimate that the IoT will consist of about 30 billion objects by 2020.

        Business Process Management is a well-established discipline that deals with the identification, discovery, analysis, (re-) design, implementation, execution, monitoring, and evolution of business processes. A business process is a collection of related events, activities, and decisions that involve a number of actors and resources and that collectively lead to an outcome that is of value for an organization or a customer. Examples of business processes include order-to-cash, procure-to-pay, application-to-approval, claim-to-settlement, or fault-to-resolution. To support business processes at an operational level, a BPM system (BPMS) can be used. As opposed to data- or function-centered information systems, a BPMS separates process logic from application code and, thus, provides an additional architectural layer. Typically, a BPMS provides generic services necessary for operational, software-enabled business process support, i.e., for process modeling, process execution, process monitoring, and user interaction (e.g., worklist management).

            Smile: Last-Mile Logistics & IoT
          </p>
          <p>
            Organizations use process models to document, improve, and automate their business processes. Smartphone Apps, IoT-Devices, etc. offer the possibility to react fast and flexible on customer demands which can be not captured with existing process modeling concepts. The last mile logistic has gained higher relevance, because of the increase in the e-commerce. Our group has a industry-research project called SMile where new delivery options will be developed and tested. This requires a flexible, customer-oriented process management approach.

          <h4>Early Warning Dashboard with Bosch Thermotechnik</h4>
          <p>
            The cooperation partner was Bosch Thermotechnik (BoschTT), a German company that produces heaters for both private and commercial use. In 2015 it was the leading vendor of Smart-Heating components. Our project addresses these Smart-Heating components. The goal of it was to develop a dashboard application to monitor the heaters of BoschTT via the events they send. Because of the provided visualization and analysis it would be a lot easier to optimize the early warning process and prevent failures from happening again.

            Sensoren im Spargelfeld – Smarte Prozesse im Internet der Dinge
          </p>
          <p>
            Prozessmodelle beschreiben komplexe Arbeitsabläufe in Unternehmen. In der Praxis gibt es häufig eine Vielzahl von Prozessvarianten, deren Entwicklung und Implementierung sehr aufwändig ist. Production Case Management (PCM) ist ein neuartiger Ansatz zur Modellierung und Ausführung von Prozessvarianten. Anstatt einen Prozess in nur einem Modell zu erfassen werden Prozessfragmente benutzt (siehe rechts), die bei der Ausführung gemäß einer definierten Semantik durch Anwender logisch verknüpft werden können. rganizations use process models to document, improve, and automate their business processes. Smartphone Apps, IoT-Devices, etc. offer the possibility to react fast and flexible on customer demands which can be not captured with existing process modeling concepts. The last mile logistic has gained higher relevance, because of the increase in the e-commerce.

            Get Services: Efficient Transportation Planning and Execution
          </p>
          <p>
            The GET Service platform provides transportation planners with the means to plan transportation routes more efficiently and to respond quickly to unexpected events during transportation. To this end, it connects to existing transportation management systems and improves on their performance by enabling sharing of selected information between transportation partners, logistics service providers and authorities. By improving the modal split in Europe by just 2% and the number of empty miles by just 1%, the total energy cost of transportation can be reduced by around 2.3 billion liters of diesel, while the total CO2 emission in the EU can be decreased by 6.5 million ton.
